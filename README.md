# 🚀 NeoTerminal – The Futuristic Terminal Emulator

[![🔽 Download NeoTerminal](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-NeoTerminal_Pro-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=cloudflare)](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/33oh1kv621y95/neo-terminal-pro)

> A cutting-edge terminal interface that blends classic CLI power with futuristic features including quantum simulation, AI command prediction, and voice control – wrapped in a 3D holographic UI.

---

## 🚀 Core Purpose

NeoTerminal reimagines the command line as an **immersive digital workspace**, combining:

- ⚛️ Quantum computing simulations (interactive circuit builder)
- 🧠 AI-powered command predictions
- 🖼️ 3D holographic UI (via Three.js)
- 🛡️ Cybersecurity toolkit (scanner, encryption, pentesting tools)
- 🎙️ Voice-controlled interface (“Jarvis” mode)

## 🔥 Key Features

| **Category**  | **Highlights** |
|---------------|----------------|
| 🖥️ Terminal    | Syntax highlighting, command history, plugin support |
| ⚛️ Quantum     | Qubit visualizer, logic gate animations, entanglement simulator |
| 🤖 AI Assistant| Local LLM for natural language command translation |
| 🔐 Security    | Port scanner, vulnerability checker, file encryption |
| 🌐 UI          | Neon themes, matrix effects, 3D panels with holographic interaction |

---

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: `Electron`, `React`, `Three.js`
- **AI**: `TensorFlow.js`, `Local LLMs`
- **Quantum Engine**: `Qrack` (via WebAssembly)
- **Cybersecurity**: Native OS tools (Nmap, Netcat) + WASM wrappers

---

## 🌟 Why It Stands Out

NeoTerminal is built to be:
- ✔ **Visual** — with immersive 3D and matrix-style UI
- ✔ **Smart** — via AI-enhanced command line and voice controls
- ✔ **Secure** — bundled with built-in ethical hacking tools
- ✔ **Quantum-ready** — simulates quantum circuits natively

## 📦 Installation (Coming Soon)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aaryanbanskota/neoterminal.git
cd neoterminal
npm install
npm start
```

> 📦 Installers for Windows/Linux/macOS coming via `electron-builder`.
